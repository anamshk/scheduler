# Interview Scheduler


Created an application that allows students to book an interview with the available interviewers on Monday - Friday between 12pm - 5pm.
Used node.js as backend and react as front-end application. Also, used storybook as a Visual testbed. 
Performed testing through Jest and Cypress.
