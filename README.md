# Interview Scheduler


Created a modern client application using the React view library.

Development focuses on a single page application (SPA) called Interview Scheduler, built using React.

For back-end used Node.js, Express, WebPack Dev Server, Axios and Babel. Also, used storybook as a Visual testbed. 

Data is persisted by the API server using a PostgreSQL database.

For front-end aplication used React, jQuery and AJAX. The client application communicates with an API server over HTTP, using the JSON format.

Performed testing through the project using Jest and Cypress.
